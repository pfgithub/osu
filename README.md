Branches:

- [mod-minimum-judgement](https://github.com/pfgithub/osu/tree/mod-minimum-judgement)
  - [x] Adds a mod. It's like the 'Perfect' mod, but you can configure it to any minimum level for notes.
- [editor-updates](https://github.com/pfgithub/osu/tree/editor-updates)
  - [x] Adds a hotkey (currently single quote `'`) that when pressed and held, plays the track from the
     current position. When released, it returns to the time you pressed the button. This makes it easy
     to preview a section without having to go back after pausing.
  - [ ] Adds hotkeys in the mania editor to insert notes without having to click the screen
